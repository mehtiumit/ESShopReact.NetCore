### React ESShop is a simple React E-Commerce Demo with .Net Core

# My Motivation for This Project
I want to show people how i can use react,redux and .net core web api. My reason of the using e-commerce demo it's a lot of consepts in there like JWT Auth , Routing , CRUD Operations, Design, Cart actions.

    For usage in => ClientApp/esshopfron/src/index.js
    
    axios.defaults.baseURL  =  "https://localhost:"Your Port"/api";
    
    Connection for the SQL Server in  appsettings.json => Connection String => Default connection => 
      "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Your SQL Server Connection String"
       },
       if you dont know the connection string: [Answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10479763/how-to-get-the-connection-string-from-a-database)
